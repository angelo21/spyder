# spyder

I chose to do a clone of spyder.com for my project because it looked challenging for me. I had built a lot of single page sites but I had never taken on a project this large. I learned a lot from this that will be very vaulable throughout my career. 

EDIT:
I built this project before I learned about webpack and bundling modules into a single output file. Knowing what I know now this project would be built completley differently.
